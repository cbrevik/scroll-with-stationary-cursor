# scroll-with-stationary-cursor README

## Features

Adds ability to scroll in sync with the cursor moment. For example, pressing the "up" key moves the cursor up one line as normal; the new behavior also scrolls up one line. The opposite is also true: move the cursor down a line; scroll down one line. As a result, the cursor remains the same distance from the top and bottom of the editor.
